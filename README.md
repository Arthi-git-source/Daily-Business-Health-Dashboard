Daily Business Health & Risk Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing daily business performance using operational and customer support data. The objective is to help decision-makers quickly understand business health and identify potential risks related to revenue, order fulfillment, returns, and customer issues.

Using Power BI, raw CSV data was cleaned, modeled, and analyzed to create key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Revenue, Total Orders, Return Rate, and Delayed Orders. The dashboard visualizes revenue trends, delivery status distribution, and support ticket patterns to provide actionable insights into operational efficiency and customer experience.

Power BI, SQL, Excel (CSV), GitHub
