## Key Business Insights

1. Revenue is stable on delivered orders, but delayed and cancelled orders
   reduce potential daily revenue.

2. Product returns are observed even after successful delivery,
   indicating possible quality or expectation mismatch.

3. Delivery delays are a recurring issue and directly impact
   customer support volume.

4. Support tickets related to delivery and returns form the majority,
   increasing operational workload.
